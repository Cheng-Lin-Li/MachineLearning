# Data Competition of Machine Learning by scikit-learn and Keras library
Implementations of machine learning algorithms by Python 3 for some selected data competition.

The folders included demo programs for leverage scikit-learn, Keras libraries to challenge datathon with Python 3. 

|Algorithm|Description|Link|
|------|------|--------|
|[Support Vector Regression (SVR), Neural Network, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)](https://github.com/Cheng-Lin-Li/MachineLearning/tree/master/Competition/McKinseyAnalyticsPrediction) | This task is to perform prediction for number of vehicles by given data. This is a demo program to leverage mutile models from existing libraries in one challenge. The final result can be improved by some emsemble techniques like Bootstrap aggregating (bagging), boosting, and stacking to get better performance.|[Source Code](https://github.com/Cheng-Lin-Li/MachineLearning/tree/master/Competition/McKinseyAnalyticsPrediction)|
|[Content Based Filtering and Singular Value decomposition (SVD)](https://github.com/Cheng-Lin-Li/MachineLearning/tree/master/Competition/McKinseyAnalyticsRecommendation)  | Under developing!!. This task is to perform recommendation to users/customers by given data. This is a demo program to leverage Content Based Recommender and Metadata Based Recommender like collaborative filtering (CF) algorithm in one challenge. The final result can be improved by neural network approach like Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to get a test.|[Source Code](https://github.com/Cheng-Lin-Li/MachineLearning/blob/master/Competition/McKinseyAnalyticsRecommendation/Recommendation.ipynb)|
