# Data Competition of Machine Learning by scikit-learn and Keras library
Implementations of machine learning algorithms by Python 3 for some selected data competition.

The folders included demo programs for leverage scikit-learn, Keras libraries to challenge datathon with Python 3. 

|Algorithm|Description|Link|
|------|------|--------|
|Support Vector Regression (SVR), Neural Network, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to perform prediction for number of vehicles |This is a demo program to leverage mutile models in one challenge. The final result can be improved by some emsemble techniques like Bootstrap aggregating (bagging), boosting, and stacking to get better performance.|[Source Code](https://github.com/Cheng-Lin-Li/MachineLearning/blob/master/scikit-learn/LinearRegression/sklearn-LinearRegression.py)|
