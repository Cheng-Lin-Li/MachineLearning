Implementations of machine learning algorithm by Python 3

The repository provides demo programs for implementations of basic machine learning algorithms by Python 3. I hope these programs will help people understand the beauty of machine learning theories and implementations.

I will enrich those implementations and descriptions from time to time. If you include any of my work into your website or project; please add a link to this repository and send me an email to let me know.

Your comments are welcome.
Thanks,

|Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)|GMMs are among the most statistically mature methods for data clustering (and density estimation)|[Source Code](https://github.com/Cheng-Lin-Li/MachineLearning/tree/master/GMM)|
|Hierarchical clustering (HAC)|HCA seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters from bottom up or top down. This is a bottom up implementation.|[Source Code](https://github.com/Cheng-Lin-Li/MachineLearning/tree/master/HAC)|
|Hidden Markov model (HMM) and Viterbi|HMM is a statistical Markov model in which the system being modeled is assumed to be a Markov process with unobserved (i.e. hidden) states. The Viterbi algorithmis used to compute the most probable path (as well as its probability). It requires knowledge of the parameters of the HMM model and a particular output sequence and it finds the state sequence that is most likely to have generated that output sequence. It works by finding a maximum over all possible state sequences. In sequence analysis, this method can be used for example to predict coding vs non-coding sequences.|[Viterbi Algorithm Source Code](https://github.com/Cheng-Lin-Li/MachineLearning/tree/master/HMM)|
