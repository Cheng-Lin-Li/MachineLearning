Implementations of machine learning algorithm by Python 3

The repository provides demo programs for implementations of basic machine learning algorithms by Python 3. I hope these programs will help people understand the beauty of machine learning theories and implementations.

I will enrich those implementations and descriptions from time to time. If you include any of my work into your website or project; please add a link to this repository and send me an email to let me know.

Your comments are welcome.
Thanks,
