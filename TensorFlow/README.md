# This is an implementation of MLP and LSTM by TensorFlow 1.1 in Python 3

## Project:
The one of the most challenging issue is stock price or indices prediction in the financial industry. On the other hand, machine learning and big data techniques in vision recognition has matured considerably over the last decade. This research adopts Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTMs) neural networks to compete with Dynamic-radius Species-conserving Genetic Algorithm (DSGA) for short term stock price prediction. The result indicates that MLP may have a better potential than DSGA on short term stock price prediction and that LSTMs may require more training data to surpass DSGA. 


#### Usage: python StockPriceForecasting.py (or StockPriceForecasting-LSTM.py)	

#### Input: A text file 'dow_jones_index.csv'.
The text file include 750 data records.  360 are from the first quarter of the year (Jan to Mar). 390 are from the second quarter of the year (Apr to Jun).

#### Output: Iterations and training / testing data results of selected stock index prediction.
