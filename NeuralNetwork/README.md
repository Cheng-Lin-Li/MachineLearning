# This is an example implementation of Neural Network Algorithm

## Machine Learning Algorithm: Neural Network Algorithm.

## Implementation features:
The neural network support multiple layers with multiple dimensions input and one dimension output.

## Task:
In the directory gestures, there is a set of images (source: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/faces.html) that display "down" gestures (i.e., thumbs-down images) or other gestures. In this assignment, the program is required to implement the Back Propagation algorithm for Feed Forward Neural Networks to learn down gestures from training images available in downgesture_train.list. 


The label of an image is 1 if the word "down" is in its file name; otherwise the label is 0. The pixels of an image use the gray scale ranging from 0 to 1. In your network, use one input layer, one hidden layer of size 100, and one output node. Use the value 0.1 for the learning rate. For each perceptron, use the sigmoid function (s) = 1/(1+e∆ü -s). Use 1000 training epochs; initialize all w randomly between -1000 to 1000 (you can also choose your own initialization approach, as long as it works); and then use the trained network to predict the labels for the gestures in the test images available in downgesture_test.list. For the error function, use the standard least square error function. Output predictions and accuracy.


The image file format is "pgm" <http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/pgm.html>. You may follow the link for the format details.
